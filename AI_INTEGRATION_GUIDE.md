# AI-Powered Cost Estimation with AWS Bedrock Integration

## Overview
The Cloud Migration Tool now features **AI-powered recommendations** using **AWS Bedrock** and **Claude 3 Sonnet** to provide intelligent, context-aware migration recommendations instead of static rule-based logic.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Recommendations
- **Server Instances**: Intelligent EC2 instance recommendations based on workload patterns, technology stack, and performance requirements
- **Database Migration**: Smart RDS instance sizing with engine compatibility analysis and performance optimization
- **Storage Strategy**: Optimal S3 storage class recommendations with lifecycle policies and cost optimization
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Strategic migration approach with risk assessment and timeline estimation

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Data Points
Each recommendation now includes:
- **AI Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of why specific recommendations were made
- **Confidence Level**: AI's confidence in the recommendation (High/Medium/Low)
- **Cost Optimization Tips**: Specific suggestions to reduce costs
- **Performance Insights**: Performance-related recommendations
- **Migration Complexity**: Assessment of migration difficulty
- **Alternative Options**: Alternative recommendations for different use cases

### ðŸ”„ Fallback System
- **Graceful Degradation**: When AWS Bedrock is not available, the system falls back to rule-based recommendations
- **Transparent Indicators**: Clear indication when AI vs rule-based recommendations are being used
- **No Service Interruption**: Full functionality maintained regardless of AI availability

## Configuration

### AWS Bedrock Setup
1. **AWS Account Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Enable Bedrock in your AWS account
   # Request access to Claude 3 Sonnet model
   # Create IAM user with Bedrock permissions
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy and configure environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Add your AWS credentials
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

3. **IAM Permissions Required**:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "bedrock:InvokeModel",
           "bedrock:ListModels"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Model Configuration
- **Primary Model**: `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`
- **Region**: US East 1 (configurable)
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low randomness for consistent recommendations)
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 (comprehensive responses)

## Technical Implementation

### AI Service Architecture
```python
class AIRecommendationService:
    """AI-powered recommendation service using AWS Bedrock"""
    
    def get_server_recommendation(server_specs) -> AI_Recommendation
    def get_database_recommendation(db_specs) -> AI_Recommendation
    def get_storage_recommendation(storage_specs) -> AI_Recommendation
    def get_comprehensive_analysis(infrastructure) -> Strategic_Analysis
```

### Recommendation Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gather current infrastructure specifications
2. **AI Analysis**: Send structured prompts to Claude 3 Sonnet
3. **Response Processing**: Parse and validate AI responses
4. **Cost Integration**: Combine AI recommendations with pricing data
5. **Fallback Handling**: Use rule-based logic if AI is unavailable

### Error Handling
- **Connection Failures**: Graceful fallback to rule-based recommendations
- **Model Unavailability**: Automatic retry with alternative models
- **Invalid Responses**: JSON parsing with error recovery
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic backoff and retry logic
